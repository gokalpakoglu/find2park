# Find2Park
### Who and how will use the system?
Nowadays big cities present many opportunities to people who wants to work but it comes with
some problems. One of these problems is “The parking problem”. The parking problem is not
a serious problem but sometimes it causes crisis. Our idea aims to solve that problem. To
explain our system, we can say basically people who have car can see which parking
area/garage is full, how many parking slots are left to park and to help them to solve this
problem.
### What will the system do, how will the system help its users accomplish their tasks?
If you decided to go to crowded places of your city with your car you will probably think about
parking places. But the main purpose of our system is; make you not think about this problem.
When a user opens our application on his/her mobile phone, the application shows how many
parking slots are left and also which parking area/garage has an empty slot to park his/her car.
Therefore, the application allows to user compare the costs between garages. Users will be able
to save their times and calculating the money which users pay are the main benefit our
application. Also, our application will reduce the waste of gasoline and carbon dioxide
emission.
